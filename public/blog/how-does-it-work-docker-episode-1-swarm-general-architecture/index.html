            <p>Hey there!</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>I hacked another thing together, this time in order to install a highly available
Docker Swarm cluster on CoreOS (yeah, Container Linux), using Ansible.</p>
<p>If you want to try it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git clone https://github.com/sebiwi/docker-coreos.git
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>cd docker-coreos
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>make up
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You will need Ansible 2.2+, Docker, Vagrant and Molecule</p>
<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
<p>Well, <a href="https://sebiwi.github.io/blog/how-does-it-work-kube-1/">I did the same thing with Kubernetes a while ago</a>, because I wanted to test
all the different new Kubernetes features and have a local cluster to play with.
I wanted to do and have the same thing with Docker in Swarm mode. I’m also
planning on comparing both of them eventually. So I needed the whole prime
matter first: installation procedures, general architecture, networking model,
concepts and abstractions and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, I thought it would be nice to explain how every Swarm component fit
together, so everyone can understand what’s under the hood. I keep getting
questions like “what is a Kubernetes and where can I buy one?” at work, and if
it is “better than a Docker”. You won’t find the answer to the last question in
this article, but at least you will (hopefully) understand how Swarm works. You
can make up your own mind afterwards. Especially after reading both articles.</p>
<h2 id="okay-you-got-me-what-is-a-swarm">Okay, you got me. What is a Swarm?</h2>
<p>Docker Swarm is Docker’s container orchestration and clustering tool. It allows
you to deploy and orchestrate containers on a large number of hosts, while
enabling you to do some other cool things in the way.</p>
<p>There is usually mild confusion when talking about Swarm, which is relatively
normal since the name has been used to refer to different things over the years.
First, there was Docker Swarm, currently known as Docker Swarm Standalone. It
basically allowed you to turn a pool of Docker hosts into a single, large,
virtual Docker host. In this scenario, a discovery service or a key-value data
store like <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a>, <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">etcd</a> or <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Zookeeper</a> was needed in order to obtain high
availability on the manager nodes (I will discuss this point further later on in
the series).</p>
<p>Nowadays, and since Docker v1.12.0-rc1, there is something called Swarm Mode,
which is included by default in the Docker Engine. Swarm Mode allows you to
manage natively a cluster of Docker Engines. It is highly integrated with
another toolkit developed by Docker, called <a href="https://github.com/docker/swarmkit">Swarmkit</a>, which removes the need of
using a key-value data store for service discovery like you needed to do when
using Swarm Mode Standalone: it is already included in Swarm Mode.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/1/swarm.png" alt="Swarm logo">{: class=&ldquo;bigger-image&rdquo; }</p>
<figcaption class="caption">Swarm me up</figcaption>
<p>So there’s two of them. Theoretically, Docker has no plans of deprecating Docker
Swarm Standalone. From the Docker Swarm’s GitHub page:</p>
<p><strong><em>Docker does not currently have a plan to deprecate Docker Swarm. The
Docker API is backward compatible so Docker Swarm will continue to
work with future Docker Engine versions.</em></strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, from the Docker Swarm’s overview page:</p>
<p><strong><em>You are viewing docs for legacy standalone Swarm. These topics describe
standalone Docker Swarm. In Docker 1.12 and higher, Swarm mode is integrated
with Docker Engine. Most users should use integrated Swarm mode&hellip; Standalone
Docker Swarm is not integrated into the Docker Engine API and CLI commands.</em></strong></p>
<p>Which means that even if they’re still maintaining Swarm’s Standalone, Swarm
Mode is where their money is. Therefore, it’s what we’re going to be using for
this project.</p>
<p>Let us discuss architecture first.</p>
<h2 id="docker-architecture">Docker architecture</h2>
<p>Before talking about Swarm, I’d like to talk about Docker itself. I’ve mentioned
the Docker Engine quite a few times without actually describing what it really
is. It is basically a client-server application with three major components: a
command-line interface (CLI), a REST API and a server.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The server is a daemon process called dockerd. It listens for Docker API
requests and manages all Docker resources, such as images, networks, containers
and volumes. It can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker
services (more on this later)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The REST API is served by the Docker Engine, and it allows clients to talk to
the daemon and control every aspect of it. It can be accessed with any HTTP
client, but if you want to stay “official” there are many standard SDKs on many
languages, and there is also the standard CLI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The command-line interface is the primary and most frequently used way of
communicating with the server</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/1/engine-components-flow.png" alt="Engine components">{: class=&ldquo;bigger-image&rdquo; }</p>
<figcaption class="caption"><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/#docker-engine">Not your regular engine</a></figcaption>
<p>Basically, you use the CLI to talk and interact with the Docker daemon, through
the REST API. The daemon then creates all the necessary resources such as
containers, networks and volumes. The client and the server may coexist on the
same machine, or they may also be on different hosts.</p>
<p>Docker is composed of many different things at an engine-level too. It is
Docker’s plan to <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2015/06/runc/">separate and release all of its infrastructure plumbing
software</a>, and they’re doing a great job so far. As of Docker 1.12, the Engine
is decomposed and built upon two different tools: <a href="https://runc.io/">runC</a> and <a href="https://containerd.io/">containerd</a>.</p>
<p>First, runC is a CLI tool for running containers. The Docker Engine used to do
that before. First by using <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a>, and then with <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/tree/master/libcontainer">libcontainer</a>. Nowadays,
libcontainer is still used, but only by runC. Another cool thing about this is
that runC is able to run Open Container Initiative (<a href="https://www.opencontainers.org/">OCI</a>) containers. OCI is a
standardisation initiative which specify a common interface for containers
images and container engines, effectively enabling any container build with a
any OCI-compatible tool to run on any OCI-compatible engine. In other words,
these are containers that abide by a de jure container standard.</p>
<p>What is de jure, you say? Check it:</p>
<p><strong><em>De facto is a Latin phrase that means in fact (literally by or
from fact) in the sense of &ldquo;in practice but not necessarily ordained
by law&rdquo; or &ldquo;in practice or actuality, but not officially established&rdquo;,
as opposed to de jure.</em></strong></p>
<p>So basically, “De facto” is used, whereas “De jure” comes from a widely
accepted standard or law. Cool, huh? This is great, since it will theoretically
allow containers created with one engine to be run on a different engine.
Therefore its name, Open Container Initiative.At the time of writing this
article, the main OCI-compatible tools are Docker, and Rocket (Rkt).</p>
<p>containerd is a daemon that uses runC to manage containers. It exposes a CRUD
container interface using gRPC, with a very simple API. This way, all the
container lifecycle actions (like starting, stopping, pausing or destroying
containers) are delegated by the Docker Engine to containerd which uses runC to
execute all its container-related actions. The Engine still manages
volumes, networks and builds, but containers are now containerd’s territory.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/1/runc-containerd.png" alt="Engine components"></p>
<figcaption class="caption"><a href="https://medium.com/@tiffanyfayj/docker-1-11-et-plus-engine-is-now-built-on-runc-and-containerd-a6d06d7e80ef">Like a layer cake</a></figcaption>
<p>There’s also another component called containerd-shim which sits between
containerd and runC, acts as the container’s process parent and allow the
runtime (runC) to exit after starting the containers. This whole thing is
pretty funny, because the Docker Engine is not able to run containers by itself
anymore: it delegates all these tasks to runC and containerd (and
containerd-shim, somehow).</p>
<p>That’s about it for the Docker architecture. Let’s talk about Swarm now.</p>
<h2 id="swarm-architecture-and-concepts">Swarm architecture and concepts</h2>
<p>A Swarm is created by one or many Docker Engines, which uses swarmkit for all
the cluster-management and orchestration features. You can enable Swarm mode by
either creating a new Swarm or joining an existing Swarm.</p>
<p>When using Swarm, you don’t launch single containers, but rather services. But
before talking about that, I need to talk about nodes.</p>
<p>A node is just a Docker Engine that is a member of the Swarm. There are two
types of nodes: Managers and Worker nodes. A Manager node receives a service
definition and then it dispatches tasks to Worker nodes accordingly. They also
do the orchestration and cluster management functions required to maintain the
desired state of the swarm. There may be many Manager nodes on a Swarm, but
there is only one leader, which is elected by all the other Manager nodes using
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raft_(computer_science)">Raft algorithm</a> and which performs all the orchestration tasks.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/GpkVwipWeyutZySkYL7NpXPDs.js" id="asciicast-GpkVwipWeyutZySkYL7NpXPDs" async height="5"></script>
<p>Worker nodes receive and execute tasks from Manager nodes. By default, Manager
nodes are also Worker nodes, but they can be configured to not accept any
workload <strong><em><del>(just like real-life managers)</del></em></strong> therefore becoming acting as
Manager-only nodes. There is also an agent on every Worker node, which reports
on the state of its tasks to the Manager <strong><em><del>(so basically, middle-management)</del></em></strong>.
That way, the Manager can maintain the desired state of the cluster.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/1/swarm-diagram.png" alt="Swarm diagram"></p>
<p><em>A service is the definition of one (or many) tasks to be executed on Worker
nodes.</em> When creating a service, you need to specify which container image to
use, and which commands to execute inside the containers. A service may be
global, or replicated. When the service is global, it will run on every
available node once. When it’s replicated, the Manager distributes the given
number of tasks on the nodes based on the desired scale number. This number may
also be one.</p>
<p>A task is just a container and the commands to be run inside of the container.
It is the standard scheduling unit of Swarm. Once a task is assigned to a node,
it can’t be moved to another node. It either runs on the selected node, or
fails.</p>
<p>So that’s about it for this first chapter. On the next episode, I’ll talk to
you about Docker (and Swarm’s) networking model.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
