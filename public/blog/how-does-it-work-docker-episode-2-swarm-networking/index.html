            <h2 id="so-what-about-networking-then">So what about networking then?</h2>
<p>Right, networking. From a <a href="https://sebiwi.github.io/blog/how-does-it-work-kube-2/">previous article on Kubernetes
Networking</a>:</p>
<pre><code>“For each container that is created, a virtual ethernet device is
attached to this bridge, which is then mapped to eth0 inside the
container, with an ip within the aforementioned network range. Note
that this will happen for each host that is running Docker, without
any coordination between the hosts.  Therefore, the network ranges
might collide.

Because of this, containers will only be able to communicate with
containers that are connected to the same virtual bridge. In order to
communicate with other containers on other hosts, they must rely on
port-mapping. This means that you need to assign a port on the host
machine to each container, and then somehow forward all traffic on
that port to that container. What if your application needs to
advertise its own IP address to a container that is hosted on another
node? It doesn’t actually knows its real IP, since his local IP is
getting translated into another IP and a port on the host machine. You
can automate the port-mapping, but things start to get kinda complex
when following this model.

That’s why Kubernetes chose simplicity and skipped the dynamic
port-allocation deal. It just assumes that all containers can
communicate with each other without Network Address Translation (NAT),
that all containers can communicate with each node (and vice-versa),
and that the IP that a container sees for itself is the same that the
other containers see for it”
</code></pre>
<p>Docker doesn’t do this. They just went nuts and decided to go crazy on the
dynamic port-forwarding part. For this, they relied heavily on the existing
Linux kernel’s networking stack. This is fairly cool, since the existing Linux
networking features are pretty mature and robust already.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/2/networking.png" alt="Docker networking"></p>
<figcaption class="caption"><a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-networking-design-philosophy/">You there?</a></figcaption>
<p>In order to provide its networking, Docker uses numerous Linux networking tools
as building blocks to handle all of its forwarding, segmentation and management
needs. Primarily, the most used tools are Linux bridges, network namespaces,
virtual ethernet devices and iptables.</p>
<p>A <strong>Linux bridge</strong> is a virtual implementation of a physical switch inside of the
Linux kernel. It forwards traffic basing itself on MAC addresses, which are in
turn discovered dynamically by inspecting traffic.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/0c2Msy5pcD0lqrXYyM9gPbJw5.js" id="asciicast-0c2Msy5pcD0lqrXYyM9gPbJw5" async height="5"></script>
<p>A <strong>network namespace</strong> is an isolated network stack with its own collection of
interfaces, routes and firewall rules. Network namespaces are used to provide
isolation between processes, analog to regular namespaces They ensure that two
containers, even if they are on the same host, won’t be able to communicate
with each other unless explicitly configured to do so.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/zA8WmkS4dkxXcoWY94RXQvT81.js" id="asciicast-zA8WmkS4dkxXcoWY94RXQvT81" async height="5"></script>
<p><strong>Virtual ethernet</strong> devices or veth are interface that act as connections between
two network namespaces. They have a single interface in each namespace. When a
container is attached to a Docker Network, one end of the veth is placed inside
the container under the name of ethx, and the other is attached to the Docker
Network.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/UMJSwnyI9ADRG3Wgi0RPA1a7I.js" id="asciicast-UMJSwnyI9ADRG3Wgi0RPA1a7I" async height="5"></script>
<p><strong>Iptables</strong> is a package filtering system, which acts as a layer 3/4 firewall and
provide packet marking, masquerading and dropping features. The native Docker
Drivers use iptables in heavy amounts in order to do network segmentation, port
mapping, mark traffic and load balance packets.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/vSlSCYzz365LJNKufNyxZxz1U.js" id="asciicast-vSlSCYzz365LJNKufNyxZxz1U" async height="5"></script>
<p>Now that you know all that, let’s talk about models.</p>
<h2 id="give-me-some-cnm">Give me some CNM!</h2>
<p>I talked to you about the Container Network Interface (CNI) <a href="https://sebiwi.github.io/blog/how-does-it-work-kube-5/">when talking about
Kubernetes on a previous article</a>. Docker uses a different standard, called the
Container Network Model (CNM) which is implemented by Docker’s libnetwork.</p>
<p>There are three main components of the CNM model: Sandboxes, Endpoints and
Networks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/2/cnm.jpeg" alt="CNM diagram"></p>
<figcaption class="caption">You there?</figcaption>
<p>The <strong>Sandbox</strong> contains the configuration of the container’s network stack, such
as interface management, IP and MAC addresses, routing tables and DNS settings.
A Sandbox may contain endpoints from multiple networks.</p>
<p>The <strong>Endpoint</strong> connects a Sandbox to a Network. An Endpoint can belong to only
one Network, and one Sandbox. It gives connectivity to the services that are
exposed in a Network by a container.</p>
<p>The <strong>Network</strong> is a collection of Endpoints that are able to talk to each other. A
Network consists of many endpoints.</p>
<p>Each one of these components has an associated CNM object on libnetwork and a
couple of other abstractions that allow the whole thing to work together
nicely.</p>
<p>The <strong>NetworkController object</strong> exposes an API entrypoint to libnetwork, which
users (like the Docker Engine) use in order to allocate and manage Networks. It
also binds a specific driver to a network.</p>
<p>The <strong>Driver object</strong>, not directly visible to the user, makes Networks work in the
end. It is configured through the NetworkController. There are both native
Drivers (such as Bridge, Host, None, Overlay, and MACVLAN) and remote (from
plugin providers) that can be used for different situations depending on your
needs. Basically the Driver owns a network and handles all of its management.</p>
<p>The <strong>Network object</strong> is an implementation of the Network component. It is created
using the NetworkController. The corresponding Driver object will be notified
upon its creation, or modification. The Driver will then connect Endpoints that
belong to the same Network, and isolate those who belong to different ones.
This provided connectivity can span many hosts, therefore, the Network object
has a global scope within a cluster.</p>
<p>The <strong>Endpoint object</strong> is basically a Service Endpoint. A Network object provides
an API to create and manage Endpoints. It can only be attached to one Network.
It provides connectivity from and to Services provided by other containers in
the Network. They are global to the cluster as well, since they represent a
Service rather than a particular container.</p>
<p>The <strong>Sandbox object</strong>, much like the component described above, represents the
configuration of the container’s network stack, such as interface management,
IP and MAC addresses, routing tables and DNS settings. It is created when a
user requests an Endpoint creation on a Network. When this happens, the Driver
in charge of the Network allocates the necessary network resources, such as an
IP address, and passes that information, labeled as SandboxInfo back to
libnetwork, which will in turn use the specific OS tools to create the network
configuration on the container that correspond to the previously mentioned
Sandbox. A Sandbox object may have multiple Endpoints, and therefore, may be
connected to multiple Networks. Its scope is local, since it is associated to a
particular container on a given host.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, there are two basic type of Drivers: <strong>native</strong> and <strong>remote</strong>.
Native Drivers don’t require any extra modules and are included in the Docker
Engine by default.</p>
<p>Native Drivers include: <strong>Host, Bridge, Overlay, MACVLAN and None</strong>.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/8tjtYy6K7l5hCAo0Gk9Wg8VtM.js" id="asciicast-8tjtYy6K7l5hCAo0Gk9Wg8VtM" async height="5"></script>
<p>When using the <strong>Host driver</strong>, the container uses the Host’s network stack,
without any namespace separation, and while sharing all of the host’s
interfaces.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/xQwYXKrskPqjbXh5dCuJpnrbI.js" id="asciicast-xQwYXKrskPqjbXh5dCuJpnrbI" async height="5"></script>
<p>The <strong>Bridge driver</strong> creates a Docker-managed Linux bridge on the Docker host. By
default, all containers created on the same bridge can talk to each other.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/7D9BlymkNju8qwgTYpPWeCS9u.js" id="asciicast-7D9BlymkNju8qwgTYpPWeCS9u" async height="5"></script>
<p>The <strong>Overlay driver</strong> creates an overlay network that may span over multiple
Docker hosts. It uses both local Linux bridges and VXLAN to overlay
inter-container communication over physical networks.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/xi12J6wrrEM3v3gNoOHJW1Baw.js" id="asciicast-xi12J6wrrEM3v3gNoOHJW1Baw" async height="5"></script>
<p>The <strong>MACVLAN</strong> driver uses the MACVLAN bridge mode to establish connections
between container interfaces and parent host interfaces. They can be used to
assign IP addresses that are routable on physical networks to containers.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/bh7F1lWgFknXoOWuEcADiglsB.js" id="asciicast-bh7F1lWgFknXoOWuEcADiglsB" async height="5"></script>
<p>The <strong>None</strong> driver gives a container its own network stack and namespace, without
any interfaces. Therefore, it stays isolated from every other Network, and even
its own host’s network stack.</p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/YrMcavMgMDlahlKIHudQyA7YN.js" id="asciicast-YrMcavMgMDlahlKIHudQyA7YN" async height="5"></script>
<p>Remote drivers are created either by vendors or the community. The Remote
Drivers that are compatible with CNM are <a href="http://contiv.github.io/">contiv</a>, <a href="https://www.weave.works/docs/net/latest/overview/">weave</a>, <a href="https://www.projectcalico.org/">calico</a> (<strong>which we used
on our Kubernetes deployment!</strong>) and <a href="https://github.com/openstack/kuryr">kuryr</a>. I won’t be talking about these since
we will not be using them.</p>
<p>Different networks drivers have different scopes. We will talk about overlay
networks, since they hold a “swarm” scope, which means that they have the same
Network ID through the cluster, and which is what we wanted to explain in the
first place.</p>
<h2 id="overlay-networks">Overlay Networks!</h2>
<p>How come you don’t need a key-value datastore, you say? It’s all because of
Docker’s Network Control Plane. It manages the state of Docker Networks within
a Swarm cluster, while also propagating control-plane data. It uses a gossip
protocol to propagate all the aforementioned information. It is scoped by
Network, which is quite cool since it dramatically reduces the amount of
updates a host receives.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/2/control-plane.png" alt="Control plane"></p>
<figcaption class="caption"><a
href="https://success.docker.com/Architecture/Docker_Reference_Architecture%3A_Designing_Scalable%2C_Portable_Docker_Container_Networks">Control that cluster</a></figcaption>
<p>It is built upon many components that work together in order to achieve fast
convergence, even in large scale clusters and networks.</p>
<p>Messages are passed in a peer-to-peer fashion, expanding the information in
each exchange to an even larger group of nodes. Both the intervals of
transmission and the size of the peering groups are fixed, which helps keeping
the network usage in check. Network failures are detected using hello messages
which helps to rule out both link congestion and false node failures. Full
state syncs are done often, in order to achieve consistency faster and fix
network partitions. Also, topology-aware algorithms are used in order to
optimize peering groups using relative latency as criteria.</p>
<p>Overlay networks rely heavily on this Network Control Plane. It uses standard
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Extensible_LAN">VXLAN</a> to encapsulate container traffic and send it to other containers.
Basically, VXLAN is an encapsulation format that wraps Layer 2 segments with an
IP/UDP header, and then send it over Layer 3 networks. In this case, the Layer
2 frames come from a container. This “underlay” header provides transportation
between hosts on the underlay network, while the overlay is the stateless VXLAN
tunnel, that exists as point-to-multipoint connections between each host
participating in the overlay network.</p>
<p><img src="/images/how-does-it-work-docker/2/overlay-network.png" alt="Overlay networks"></p>
<figcaption class="caption"><a
href="https://success.docker.com/Architecture/Docker_Reference_Architecture%3A_Designing_Scalable%2C_Portable_Docker_Container_Networks">Like this</a></figcaption>
<p>For example, in the previous diagram:</p>
<ul>
<li>c1 is sending c2 packets through a shared overlay network. What
happens is that c1 does a DNS lookup for c2. They are both on the
same overlay network, so the Docker Engine local DNS service
resolves c2 to 10.0.0.3, its overlay address.</li>
<li>C1 generates an L2 frame destined for the MAC address of c2.</li>
<li>The overlay network driver then encapsulates the frame with a VXLAN
header, with the physical address of host-B, which he knows by
knowing the state and location of every VXLAN tunnel endpoint through
the control plane.</li>
<li>The packet is then sent and routed as a normal packet using the
physical network.</li>
<li>Finally, the packet is received by host-B, decapsulated by the
overlay network driver, and passed on to c2.</li>
</ul>
<p>This whole process seriously resembles the <a href="https://sebiwi.github.io/blog/how-does-it-work-kube-2/">SDN protocol implemented by flannel</a>,
described on the Kubernetes networking part of its “How does it work” series,
with flanneld replacing the overlay network driver. Neat, huh? Great minds
think alike.</p>
<p>What about the driver itself? It automates all the VXLAN configuration needed
for an overlay network. When creating the network, the Docker Engine creates
the necessary infrastructure on each host. A Linux bridge is created for each
overlay network, with its associated VXLAN interfaces. The overlay is only
instantiated on hosts when a container that belongs to the network is scheduled
on the host, preventing unnecessary spreading of the overlay networks when they
are not needed.</p>
<p>When a container is created, at least two network interfaces are created inside
of it: one that connects it to the overlay bridge, and the other to the
docker_gwbridge. The overlay bridge is the ingress/egress point to the overlay
network that the VXLAN encapsulates. It also extends the overlay across all the
hosts that participate in this particular overlay. There is one per overlay
subnet on each host, with the same name as the overlay network. The
docker_gwbridge is the egress bridge for all the traffic that leaves the
cluster. There is only one docker_gwbridge per host. Container-to-container
traffic flows do not go through this bridge.</p>
<p>As I said before, overlay networks span multiple Docker hosts. They can be
either managed by a Swarm cluster on Swarm Mode, or without it. Nevertheless,
when you’re not using Swarm Mode, you will need a valid key-value store service
(<a href="https://coreos.com/etcd">etcd</a>, <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> or <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Zookeeper</a>) in order for the network to work properly. This
mode of operation is not encouraged by Docker, and it might even be deprecated
in the future (which further discredits the whole “we’re not deprecating Swarm
Standalone” argument).</p>
